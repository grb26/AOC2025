Solutions are in ./src/solutions.
Run a web UI with `npx ts-node server.ts`. 
Can also run the tests for individual days using `npm test {day}` where day is a number, or omitted to test all days.

The goal here is to learn some javascript. The solutions are hand-coded, the framework is generated by AI as a teaching tool.
